## Project Overview
### Overview
- **Tagline:** is the go-to gamer acquisition platform, powering high-performing on-chain tournaments that drive real engagement. We help studios reach thousands of real players with a plug-and-play solution that delivers measurable impact fast.
- **Description:**
N3MUS is a Web3-native tournament platform designed to integrate directly with Polkadot-native and Ecosystem games. It allows games and studios to run interactive, reward-based tournaments where players complete in-game and social tasks to climb leaderboards and earn rewards.
By leveraging Polkadot's infrastructure, N3MUS offers an interoperable, scalable, and secure environment to execute and verify tournament results on-chain.

- **🔥 Traction (March 2025):**

    - 108,000+ Gameplays (109% MoM Growth)
    - 30 Tournaments | 6,750+ Players
    - Responsible for 6,300+ Gameplay Hours
    - Partnered with Flamengo (48M fans) | launching on-chain CS2 tournaments
    - Expanding to pro esports teams & top Web2 titles

- **Relation to Polkadot/Substrate:**
N3MUS is already live on Moonbeam, where the platform and participating games account for 8% of all Moonbeam daily network traffic, with 109% month-over-month growth. As we expand deeper into the Polkadot ecosystem, we will leverage XCM and parachain integrations to manage tournament creation, reward distribution, and result publishing in a transparent and verifiable way, while respecting the technical limitations and roles of each parachain.
Our goal is to support both Polkadot-native games and broader ecosystem games by offering true cross-parachain interoperability. Game studios will be provided with an SDK or scripts to integrate N3MUS into their existing stack in under 4 hours.

- **What studios on Moonbeam are currently saying about N3MUS**:
    - Studios call it “the N3MUS effect.” One said: “Our game crashed from the number of gameplays, it was wild.” Another: “Integration was super easy, we were live in under an hour.” We’ve helped games go from zero to 10,000+ gameplays in just one week. The games include; Pinkdrop, The Great Escape, WeGainst, Data2073, Zoombies and we are onboarding several more games within the ecosystem (FlappyWud, Chess on Chain, Nitro Nations) and a few games from outside the ecosystem.

    ⚠️ **We are applying for a grant where 85% of the funding will be allocated to Community Incentives, directly growing the ecosystem and incentivizing activity across games and parachains on Polkadot.**

 - **Why Polkadot:**
We selected Polkadot for its modular scalability, low-latency transaction finality, and vibrant developer community. Its strong focus on security and interoperability makes it the ideal foundation for building a competitive gaming layer across parachains. With the growing presence of gaming projects like Mythical Games and others, Polkadot offers the infrastructure and community needed to support scalable, cross-chain gaming experiences.
We're also aligning with Distractive on the Q2 ecosystem incentives focused on gaming, perfectly timed to maximize user acquisition and engagement across all participating games in the Polkadot ecosystem.

The upcoming PolkaVM/Solidity competiability on the AssetHub brings us a great oppertunity to deploy our smart contracts there and bring the traction directly to Polkadot. We will fully open source the whole integration stack required to run on-chain tournaments including the smart contracts, unity/unreal SDKs, scripts etc!

### Ecosystem Fit
- **Fit into Polkadot Ecosystem:**

N3MUS is a layer for gamified engagement across Polkadot ecosystem-native games. We are bridging community interaction, competitive mechanics, and transparent scorekeeping into one stack.

- **Target Audience:**
    - Game studios building on Polkadot;
    - Web2 games and gamers;
    - Players from within the ecosystem;
    - DAO developers and gaming dApps.
- **Needs Being Met:**
    - Lack of cross-game (&ecosystem) tournament infrastructure;
    - Transparent, trustless tournament results;
    - Engaging quests and rewards system for actual gamers (not just point/airdrop farmers).

- **Evidence:**
    - Active case study on Moonbeam with 10K+ players and 100K+ gameplays;
    - Twitter & Telegram feedback on need for transparency and engagement;
    - Internal usage data with >60% player return rate;
    - All our participants and tournament data is fully on chain;
    - Proven track record: from zero to 10K transactions in a single week for a new game tournament.

- **Similar Projects:**
    
No fully integrated tournament platform currently exists across the Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem. Competitors in other ecosystems (e.g., Galxe Quests, Layer3, Airlyft) focus primarily on social or wallet-based quests, offering limited gameplay-based engagement and lacking any form of on-chain score verification.

In contrast, N3MUS combines a robust questing and mission system directly tied to a dynamic leaderboard, ensuring only real in-game actions count toward rewards. This approach eliminates exploitation by airdrop hunters or bot-driven activity, as participation requires genuine gameplay.
    
By onboarding actual gamers and verifying real activity, N3MUS delivers sustainable, high-quality growth for games in the ecosystem.
- **Why Now & Why Here:**

Polkadot’s growth in gaming including DotPlay, LAOS, Ajuna, Moonbeam, and Mythical Games has created a ripe opportunity for player-centric infrastructure that connects gameplay, identity, and rewards across the ecosystem. N3MUS fills that gap by offering the tools and tournament framework needed to turn fragmented gaming activity into unified, on-chain engagement.
With the upcoming Q2 Polkadot gaming incentives, we’re perfectly positioned to activate large-scale tournaments and quest-based campaigns that drive real player acquisition and retention across parachains. Rather than relying on passive exposure, N3MUS creates active engagement loops that reward players for participating in ecosystem games, completing in-game and on-chain objectives, and climbing cross-game leaderboards. Gaming is becoming a big thing within Polkadot with already a dozen of popular games, we are here to grow the number of players and games.
We will also leveraging Polkadots partnership with HEROIC and their AimDots CS2 map, transforming it from a static Polkadot-branded experience into an actual on-chain onboarding funnel. Through CS2 tournaments powered by N3MUS.
